Notable elements of my SuperPy implementation:
1. The Pandas DataFrame.
I decided to use the Pandas Dataframe software to keep track of the supermarket inventory as well as the registration of bought and sold products. This system is able to store two-dimensional data in a clear and efficient way. Furthermore, it allows for easy searching, filtering and manipulation of the datasets. Since this data structure is widely used, it also allows for easy use and interpretation by other users. The data is locally stored in a pickle file (.pkl) so the data can be loaded and manipulated according to the different commands. In additon, the Pandas library contains modules to work with dates and csv files, which are largely similar to the ones used by the standard library. 
2. Selecting products on both Product_name and Expiration_date.
Since products might have the same Product_name, but could have a different Expiration_dates, these products should be seperated from eachother in the inventory file. If buying a new product with the same Product_name, the quantity of the products will only be increased if the product also has the same Expiration_date. Otherwise, the product will be listed as a new product. If an item with a similar Product_name and Expiration_date is bought at different timepoints, the Buy_date will be updated to the most recently used Buy_date. 
3. The reset command
The current inventory, and overviews of bought/sold products can easily be deleted with the reset command, so the user can start adding files with a clean slate. In addition, the generated .csv and .pdf will also be deleted from the working directory with this function.
